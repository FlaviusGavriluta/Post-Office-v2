# Post Office

Two kinds of things can be posted:

## Letters:

* they have address,
* date when it was posted,
* fixed price of 1.99 euros

## Boxes:

* they have two types (small and big box),
* address, date when it was posted 
* weight of the box measured in grams and their price is calculated differently.
a. small boxes are 7.99 euros,
b. big boxes are 10.29 euros + 0.29 * every grams of their weight


## The post office can:

* store all posted items
* list all of the things posted on a given date
* calculate the total income from the posted things of a given type (letter, small box, big box)
